                    <h6 class="title-sub-1">Nilruk in finance, Sethpriya from FMCG marketing background, while Sarindu
                        became a seasoned tea taster, and Harijith an experienced entrepreneur. Years of experience
                        later, these four felt drawn to a more purposeful venture that leveraged their strengths.</h6>

                    <h6 class="title-sub-1">The guiding principle of Spice Chest was the opportunity to bring the very
                        best of Sri Lanka to the rest of the world, ethically and sustainably. Sri Lanka’s spices have
                        quietly found themselves the toast of kitchens worldwide, spanning cultures and centuries with
                        many unaware of their origins.</h6>
