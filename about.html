            <h4 class="about-more-title">The Story of Cinnamon and Ceylon Spices</h4>
            <h6 class="title-sub-1">
                Tracing back to antiquity, spices and their trade have shaped not only Sri Lanka’s history but the fates
                of the entire world through determining the flow of wealth and spurring exploration. One of the most
                important of these spices was cinnamon, and Sri Lanka was its homeland. Ancient

                civilizations prized and revered cinnamon. The Bible mentions it as an ingredient in the holy anointing
                oil that God asked Moses to make and it was used in religious ceremony and embalming in Ancient Egypt
                and even bears mention. The Romans, who used cinnamon not only in food but in perfumes and medicine,
                regularly paid vast sums of gold for the spice. The spices themselves were sold exclusively by middle
                eastern merchants who were so secretive about the origins of their spices that they created fantastic
                tales of how they got them. Herodotus, in the 5th century BC, told the tale of ‘Cinnamolgus’ that were
                massive ferocious phoenixes that used cinnamon in building their nests, and the only way for cinnamon to
                be taken was by experts that would dress in animal hide and leave heavy chunks of animal flesh for these
                beasts to carry up which would fall out of their grasp and knock off pieces of their cinnamon-y nests.
            </h6>

            <h6 class="title-sub-1">
                The real expertise lay in the ability of the Middle Eastern traders to protect their trade secrets.
                Through these traders, civilisations grew. As Rome had to rely on the middle east for spices, cinnamon
                being the most expensive, vast amounts of roman gold flowed into trade hubs like

                Alexandria which grew in wealth, technology, and populace, developing the entire region. Crusades were
                fought in the 11th Century AD between Christians and Muslims, and outwardly though they seemed at way,
                the trade of spices through cities like Jerusalem made fortunes for Middle Eastern and European traders
                alike and catalysed the creation of trade routes across the centre of the world.
            </h6>

            <h6 class="title-sub-1">
                Eventually Europe would be compelled to travel in search of the spices they had to pay so dearly for.
                When Marco Polo returned to Europe in the 14th century with stories of his travels throughout Asia, the
                mystique of Asia overcame the European elite who organised voyages to the alluring continent to find
                spices. Portugal’s king sent Vasco Da Gama to find spices like cinnamon, pepper and clove, and his
                voyage led him all the way around Africa and finally to the Indian Ocean. Da Gama succeeded in finding
                India and Sri Lanka, and by forcefully taking the spice-trade routes of the sea from the Middle East,
                brought incredible wealth to Portugal.
            </h6>

            <h6 class="title-sub-1">
                Finding Sri Lanka to be the source of Cinnamon, Portugal sought out her rival kings, allying with one
                side to overthrow the other while taking trade concessions and gargantuan amounts of cinnamon as
                repayment for their help. Portugal would start with coastal bases and forcefully work their way into the
                island, taking coastal cities like Colombo and Galle. The artisanal quality of Ceylon’s cinnamon was
                cemented at this time as the Portuguese created laws that allowed only the skilled master cinnamon
                peelers to peel cinnamon, and their expertise have been passed down generations to where even today
                proper cinnamon peeling is an esoteric art that cannot be machine automated.
            </h6>

            <h6 class="title-sub-1">
                Spices like pepper, cinnamon, nutmeg, and clove were highly sought after not only for their effect on
                food but because they signalled wealth, and they would fetch incredibly high prices. Control of spice
                trading routes meant incredible wealth that could lead to insurmountable power. The Ottomans would fight
                the Portuguese for the spice routes, growing considerably with their successes, and eventually the Dutch
                East India company would drive the Portuguese out of many of their strongholds, including Sri Lanka.
                Needing to get the Portuguese out, Sri Lankan kings allied with the Dutch who to no one’s surprise took
                monopoly of cinnamon for themselves. Cinnamon was the Dutch East India company’s most profitable item,
                and just like the Portuguese, controlling the spice trade funded development and inspired exploration
                and expansion. Even Columbus’ voyage to America was meant to be a trip to Asia to find spices, and to
                further fund his expedition Columbus would tell King Ferdinand and Queen Isabella of varieties of spices
                including cinnamon he had found although he’d not actually found them.
            </h6>

            <h6 class="title-sub-1">
                Sri Lanka would later fall into the hands of the British, along with much of the modern world. All these
                shifts in global power, trade networks built, and fortunes created owe themselves greatly to the
                supremely lucrative spice trade. One could even argue that it was the catalyst for globalisation.
